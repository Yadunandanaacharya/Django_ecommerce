step1: django-admin startproject Arts
step2: change your directory to Arts if it outside.
step3: python manage.py runserver
Important: step3 is very very important in your whole process you sshould runserver
more times not executing. When you execute every time every program like
running urls.py or views.py definitely you'll get error.
One more thing django is server side program.

So I will recommend not to exceute program instead, when you will "save" each time 
you will change the program, server will get restart. 

step4: python manage.py startapp musics (creating app)
step5: creating urls.py and making changes in views.py under musics app
Step6: save program each time so that server will restart.
